# Image colourisation

Submitted as part of the MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing at the University of Oxford.

--------------------------

This repository accompanies the report "Image colourisation", in which I analysed a fully automatic approach to image colourisation—the process used to add colour to a greyscale image—based on an unconstrained optimisation algorithm. It contains:
- Colourisation.m (plus Colourisation.fig): a MATLAB GUI to test and implement the method.
- main.m: base code with comments.
- col2grey.m: an auxiliary function.

Note that there is an issue with the radial basis function button, so it must be pressed again before compiling with the gaussian function.
